# Weekday Scheduler
Created by Jake Smith

## Project Description
In this project, I was tasked with creating a scheduling app that allows the user to enter and save things to do during a workday, by hour. It keeps track of the current hour, then
compares that time to the hourly time slot in the schedule, causing past timeblocks to turn green and future time blocks to turn red. When text is entered into the "to-do" areas, it 
is saved for when the user comes back.

## Technologies Used
This application relies heavily on the use of jQuery, dayJs localStorage technologies, as well as vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
